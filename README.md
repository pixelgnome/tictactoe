# React.js Tictactoe game

Created this as a more advanced project in an online React Course that covered concepts like:

- Lifting State Up
- Updating Object State Immutably
- Deriving State from Props
- Creating Flexible Components

If you download the project, open Terminal, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.
